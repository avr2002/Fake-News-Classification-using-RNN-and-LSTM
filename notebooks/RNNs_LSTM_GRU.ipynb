    "\n",
    "    - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network architecture designed to handle sequential data. This means that they can be used to model data that has a temporal order, such as text, speech, or music. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - They are particularly well-suited for tasks where the order and context of data matter, such as Time-Series Prediction, NLP, and Speech Recognition. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How does RNNs work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - RNNs maintain a hidden state that gets updated with each new input, allowing them to capture information from previous steps and use it to influence the current step's output. This hidden state represents the network's understanding of the data that it has seen so far. The hidden state is then used to predict the next element in the sequence.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Here is an example of how an RNN might be used to predict the next word in a sentence:** \n",
    "        - The RNN would start with a hidden state that is initialized to all zeros. Then, it would read the first word in the sentence, and update its hidden state based on that word. The RNN would then read the second word in the sentence, and update its hidden state again. This process would continue until the RNN has read the entire sentence. Finally, the RNN would output a prediction for the next word in the sentence.\n",

    "1. The **vanishing and exploding gradient** problems are two of the most common limitations of RNNs. These problems occur when the gradients of the loss function become very small or very large, which makes it difficult for the network to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **The vanishing gradient problem occurs when the weights of the RNN are very small. This can happen when the RNN is trying to learn long-term dependencies**, as the gradients of the loss function will be multiplied by the weights many times as the RNN propagates back through time. As a result, the gradients can become very small, which makes it difficult for the network to learn.\n",

This can happen when the RNN is trying to learn short-term dependencies**, as the gradients of the loss function will be multiplied by the weights many times as the RNN propagates back through time.

    "1. **Long-Term Memory (Cell State):** The cell state in an LSTM is designed to capture and store information that is relevant over longer sequences.

The cell state evolves and gets updated with each step, incorporating new information through the input gate and retaining or discarding information through the forget gate.\n",

However, this short-term memory is often less emphasized compared to the cell state, which focuses on capturing more persistent patterns and context.\n",
